# Part 32: Accessing Members in a Struct

This part of our compiler writing journey turned out to be quite simple. I've added
the '.' and '->' tokens to our language, and I've implemented one level of member
access to global struct variables.

I'll give our test program, `tests/input58.c`, here so that you can see the
language features that I've implemented:

```c
int printf(char *fmt);

struct fred {                   // Struct declaration, done last time
  int x;
  char y;
  long z;
};

struct fred var2;               // Variable declaration, done last time
struct fred *varptr;            // Pointer variable declaration, done last time

int main() {
  long result;

  var2.x= 12;   printf("%d\n", var2.x);         // Member access as lvalue, new
  var2.y= 'c';  printf("%d\n", var2.y);
  var2.z= 4005; printf("%d\n", var2.z);

  result= var2.x + var2.y + var2.z;             // Member access as rvalue, new
  printf("%d\n", result);

  varptr= &var2;                                // Old behaviour
  result= varptr->x + varptr->y + varptr->z;    // Member access through pointer, new
  printf("%d\n", result);
  return(0);
}
```

## The New Tokens

We have two new tokens, T_DOT and T_ARROW, to match the '.' and '->' elements
in the input. As always, I won't give the code in `scan.c` to identify these.

## Parsing the Member References

This turned out to be very similar to our existing array element accessing code.
Let's look at the similarities and the differences. With this code:

```c
  int x[5];
  int y;
  ...
  y= x[3];
```

we get the base address of the `x` array, multiply 3 by the size of the `int` type
in bytes (e.g.3*4 is 12), add that to the base address, and treat this as the
address of the `int` that we want to access. Then we dereference this address to
get the value at that array position.

Accessing a struct member is similar:

```c
  struct fred { int x; char y; long z; };
  struct fred var2;
  char y;
  ...
  y= var2.y;
```

We get the base address of `var2`. We get the offset of the `y` member in the
`fred` struct, add this to the the base address, and treat this as the
address of the `char` that we want to access. Then we dereference this address to
get the value there.

## Postfix Operators

T_DOT and T_ARROW are postfix operators, like the '[' of an array reference, as they
come after an identifier's name. So it makes sense to add their parsing in the
existing `postfix()` function in `expr.c`:

```c
static struct ASTnode *postfix(void) {
  ...
    // Access into a struct or union
  if (Token.token == T_DOT)
    return (member_access(0));
  if (Token.token == T_ARROW)
    return (member_access(1));
  ...
}
```

The argument to the new `member_access()` function in `expr.c` indicates if we
are accessing a member through a pointer or directly. Now let's look at the new
`member_access()` in stages.

```c
// Parse the member reference of a struct (or union, soon)
// and return an AST tree for it. If withpointer is true,
// the access is through a pointer to the member.
static struct ASTnode *member_access(int withpointer) {
  struct ASTnode *left, *right;
  struct symtable *compvar;
  struct symtable *typeptr;
  struct symtable *m;

  // Check that the identifer has been declared as a struct (or a union, later),
  // or a struct/union pointer
  if ((compvar = findsymbol(Text)) == NULL)
    fatals("Undeclared variable", Text);
  if (withpointer && compvar->type != pointer_to(P_STRUCT))
    fatals("Undeclared variable", Text);
  if (!withpointer && compvar->type != P_STRUCT)
    fatals("Undeclared variable", Text);
```

First, some error checking. I know I will have to add checking for unions here, so
I'm not going to refactor the code just yet.

```c
  // If a pointer to a struct, get the pointer's value.
  // Otherwise, make a leaf node that points at the base
  // Either way, it's an rvalue
  if (withpointer) {
    left = mkastleaf(A_IDENT, pointer_to(P_STRUCT), compvar, 0);
  } else
    left = mkastleaf(A_ADDR, compvar->type, compvar, 0);
  left->rvalue = 1;
```

At this point we need to get the base address of the composite variable. If we are
given a pointer, we simply load the pointer's value by making an A_IDENT AST node.
Otherwise, the identifier *is* the struct or union, so we had better get its address
with an A_ADDR AST node.

This node can't be an lvalue, i.e. we can't say `var2. = 5`. It has to be an rvalue.

```c
  // Get the details of the composite type
  typeptr = compvar->ctype;

  // Skip the '.' or '->' token and get the member's name
  scan(&Token);
  ident();
```

We get a pointer to the composite type so that we can walk the list of members in the
type, and we get the member's name after the '.' or '->'
(and confirm that it is an identifier).

```c
  // Find the matching member's name in the type
  // Die if we can't find it
  for (m = typeptr->member; m != NULL; m = m->next)
    if (!strcmp(m->name, Text))
      break;

  if (m == NULL)
    fatals("No member found in struct/union: ", Text);
```

We walk the member's list to find the matching member's name.

```c
  // Build an A_INTLIT node with the offset
  right = mkastleaf(A_INTLIT, P_INT, NULL, m->posn);

  // Add the member's offset to the base of the struct and
  // dereference it. Still an lvalue at this point
  left = mkastnode(A_ADD, pointer_to(m->type), left, NULL, right, NULL, 0);
  left = mkastunary(A_DEREF, m->type, left, NULL, 0);
  return (left);
}

```

The member's offset in bytes is stored in `m->posn` so we make an A_INTLIT node
with this value, and A_ADD it to the base address stored in `left`. At this
point we have an address of the member, so we dereference it (A_DEREF) to get access
to the member's value. At this point, this is still an lvalue; this allows us to do
both `5 + var2.x` and `var2.x= 6`.

### Running Our Test Code

The output of `tests/input58.c` is, unsurprisingly:

```
12
99
4005
4116
4116
```

Let's have a look at some of the assembly output:

```
                                        # var2.y= 'c';
        movq    $99, %r10               # Load 'c' into %r10
        leaq    var2(%rip), %r11        # Get base address of var2 into %r11
        movq    $4, %r12                
        addq    %r11, %r12              # Add 4 to this base address
        movb    %r10b, (%r12)           # Write 'c' into this new address

                                        # printf("%d\n", var2.z);
        leaq    var2(%rip), %r10        # Get base address of var2 into %r11
        movq    $4, %r11
        addq    %r10, %r11              # Add 4 to this base address
        movzbq  (%r11), %r11            # Load byte value from this address into %r11
        movq    %r11, %rsi              # Copy it into %rsi
        leaq    L4(%rip), %r10
        movq    %r10, %rdi
        call    printf@PLT              # and call printf()
```

## Conclusion and What's Next

Well, this was a nice pleasant surprise to get structs to work this easily!
I'm sure the future parts of our journey will make up for it. I also know that
our compiler as it stands still is pretty limited. For example, it can't do this:

```c
struct foo {
  int x;
  struct foo *next;
};

struct foo *listhead;
struct foo *l;

int main() {
  ...
  l= listhead->next->next;
```

as this requires following two pointer levels. The existing code can only follow
one pointer level. We will have to fix this later.

It is probably also a good time to indicate that we will have to spend a lot
of time getting the compiler to "do it right". I've been adding functionality,
but only enough to get one specific feature to work. At some point these specific
features will have to be made more general. So there will be a "mop up" stage 
in this journey.

Now that we have structs mostly working, in the next part of our compiler writing
journey, I will try to add unions.
