# Part 61: What's Next?

We've achieved the goal of writing a self-compiling
compiler. Now that this goal has been reached, what
else could we do with the codebase?

From the start, I'm going to say that there are already
a number of working, production-ready C compilers:
[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org), [LLVM](https://llvm.org)
etc. We don't need another production-ready C compiler.
But the point of writing this compiler was pedagogical:
to explain the basics of how compilers work, and to
put this knowledge into practice.

So, I see the future work on the compiler to continue
to explain how compilers work and to put this into
practice.

With this direction set, let's look at the possibilities.

## Code Cleanup

I wrote the compiler fairly quickly, with only a little
thought about the overarching design of the code. I think
the design is reasonable, but the whole codebase needs
a clean up. There's a fair bit of
[DRY code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
in places which could be refactored. Some of the code is
ugly and could be improved. Also, some of the comments no
longer reflect the code. This wouldn't change the compiler's
functionality, but it would make it easier to understand.

## Fix the Bugs

The compiler, as it stands, purports to implement a
specific subset of the C language. But I'm sure there
are plenty of bugs in this implementation. We could
spend some time identifying these bugs and fixing them,
while keeping the compiler's functionality constant.

## Write Out the Final BNF Grammar

This suggestions goes along with the previous one.
We should document the exact subset of the C language
that the compiler supports, as a BNF grammar. I did
write snippets of BNF grammar thoughout the journey,
but near the end I stopped doing it. It would be 
good to write out the full, final, BNF grammar.

## Support Variadic Functions

The compiler still doesn't check that the number of
arguments to a function matches the number of
function parameters. We need this because the compiler
also doesn't support variadic functions like `printf()`
and friends.

So, we need to add in the `...` token, somehow mark
a function has having either "exactly N" or "N or more"
parameters, and then write the code to use this information.

## Add `short`s

It shouldn't be too hard to add a 16-bit signed `short` type. But Nils
mentions, in his SubC book, that adding `unsigned` integer to a C
compiler is tricky.

## Rewrite the Register Allocation and Spilling

Right now, the mechanism for register allocation and
register spilling is really awful, especially the
spilling of registers before and after a function call.
The assembly code is terribly inefficient. I'd like
to see this rewritten using some of the theory on
register allocation, e.g
[graph colouring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation#Graph-coloring_allocation).
Even better, if this was written up like the past
journey steps, it would help newcomers (like me)
understand it better.

## AST Optimisations

I did mention the idea of optimising the generated code
by restructing the AST trees. An example of this is
[strength reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_reduction).
The [SubC](http://www.t3x.org/subc/) compiler does this,
and it would be easy to add to our compiler, along with
a writeup. There might be other AST tree optimisations
that could be done.

## Code Generation Optimisation

Another place to do output optimisation is in the code
generator. A good example is
[peephole optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole_optimization).
To do this, however, the way the assembly code is generated
would have to change. Instead of `fprintf()`ing the output,
it should be stored in a data structure to make it easier for
the peephole optimiser to traverse the assembly code. That's
as far as I've thought, but it would be interesting to do.

## Add Debugging Output

I started to do this in step 59. We should be able to output
`gdb` directives into the assembly output to allow `gdb` to
see the original C source lines, and step through a program
line by line. Right now, the compiler is outputting this
information but the `gdb` directives are not placed correctly
in the assembly output. There's another step in here with a
writeup on how to do this properly.

## Complete the ARM Backend, plus Others

I did start the ARM back-end, and at the time I promised that
I would keep it in sync with the x86-64 back-end. Well, I
broke that promise as I got too interested in extending the
compiler's functionality. Now that the compiler's functionality
is relatively stable, I should go back and complete the ARM
back-end. Even better would be a third back-end to prove that
the compiler is fairly portable.

## Extending the Recognised Grammar

I've left this suggestion to near the end as it doesn't
continue the theme of explaining how compilers work. There is
always scope to add more elements of the C language to the
compiler. We don't need to do this to make the compiler
self-compiling, but it would make the compiler more useful
as a general-purpose compiler.

## Work Out How to Call `ld` Directly

A long time ago, when I was playing around with BSD and Linux
systems, I used to be able to link excecutables by hand with
the `ld` command. I've been unable to work out how to do this
on current Linux systems, and I'm relying on `cc` to do the
linking for me. I'd love to learn how to link by hand with `ld`
on Linux.

## Port the Compiler to non-Linux Systems

Following on from the last point, it would be good to "port"
the compiler to non-Linux systems like some of the BSD platforms.

## Conclusion

These are all the possible things that I can of (at the moment)
to continue the work on our compiler. I will get on to some of
them, but at this point I'd be very happy to have other people
help out with the project, and/or fork the compiler's code and
do their own thing with it!
