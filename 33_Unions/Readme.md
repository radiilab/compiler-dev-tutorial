# Part 33: Implementing Unions and Member Access

Unions also turned out to be easy to implement for one reason: they are like
structs except that all members of a union are located at offset zero from the base of
the union. Also, the grammar of a union declaration is the same as a struct except
for the "union" keyword.

This means that we can re-use and modify the existing structs code to deal with unions.

## A New Keyword: "union"

I've added the "union" keyword and the T_UNION token to the scanner in `scan.c`.
As always, I'll omit the code that does the scanning.

## The Union Symbol List

As with structs, there is a singly-linked list to store unions (in `data.h`):

```c
extern_ struct symtable *Unionhead, *Uniontail;   // List of struct types
```

In `sym.c`, I've also written `addunion()` and `findunion()` functions to
add a new union type node to the list and to search for a union type with a given
name on the list.

> I'm considering merging the struct and union lists into a single composite type
  list, but I haven't done it yet. I'll probably do it when I get around to some
  more refactoring.

## Parsing Union Declarations

We are going to modify the existing struct parsing code in `decl.c` to parse
both structs and unions. I'll only give the changes to the functions, not the
whole functions.

In `parse_type()`, we now scan the T_UNION token and call the function to parse
both struct and union types:

```c
  case T_STRUCT:
    type = P_STRUCT;
    *ctype = composite_declaration(P_STRUCT);
    break;
  case T_UNION:
    type = P_UNION;
    *ctype = composite_declaration(P_UNION);
    break;
```

This function `composite_declaration()` was called `struct_declaration()` in the
last part of our journey. It now takes the type that we are parsing.

## The `composite_declaration()` Function

Here are the changes:

```c
// Parse composite type declarations: structs or unions.
// Either find an existing struct/union declaration, or build
// a struct/union symbol table entry and return its pointer.
static struct symtable *composite_declaration(int type) {
  ...
  // Find any matching composite type
  if (type == P_STRUCT)
    ctype = findstruct(Text);
  else
    ctype = findunion(Text);
  ...
  // Build the composite type and skip the left brace
  if (type == P_STRUCT)
    ctype = addstruct(Text, P_STRUCT, NULL, 0, 0);
  else
    ctype = addunion(Text, P_UNION, NULL, 0, 0);
  ...
  // Set the position of each successive member in the composite type
  // Unions are easy. For structs, align the member and find the next free byte
  for (m = m->next; m != NULL; m = m->next) {
    // Set the offset for this member
    if (type == P_STRUCT)
      m->posn = genalign(m->type, offset, 1);
    else
      m->posn = 0;

    // Get the offset of the next free byte after this member
    offset += typesize(m->type, m->ctype);
  }
  ...
  return (ctype);
}
```

That's it. We simply change the symbol table list we are working on, and
always set the member offset to zero for unions. This is why I think it
would be worth merging the struct and union type lists into a single list.

## Parsing Union Expressions

As with the union declarations, we can reuse the code that deals with
structs in expressions. In fact, there are very few changes to make in `expr.c`.

```c
// Parse the member reference of a struct or union
// and return an AST tree for it. If withpointer is true,
// the access is through a pointer to the member.
static struct ASTnode *member_access(int withpointer) {
  ...
  if (withpointer && compvar->type != pointer_to(P_STRUCT)
      && compvar->type != pointer_to(P_UNION))
    fatals("Undeclared variable", Text);
  if (!withpointer && compvar->type != P_STRUCT && compvar->type != P_UNION)
    fatals("Undeclared variable", Text);
```

Again, that's it. The rest of the code was generic enough that we can use it for
unions unmodified. And I think there was only one other major change, which was
to a function in `types.c`:

```c
// Given a type and a composite type pointer, return
// the size of this type in bytes
int typesize(int type, struct symtable *ctype) {
  if (type == P_STRUCT || type == P_UNION)
    return (ctype->size);
  return (genprimsize(type));
}
```

## Testing the Union Code

Here's our test program, `test/input62.c`:

```c
int printf(char *fmt);

union fred {
  char w;
  int  x;
  int  y;
  long z;
};

union fred var1;
union fred *varptr;

int main() {
  var1.x= 65; printf("%d\n", var1.x);
  var1.x= 66; printf("%d\n", var1.x); printf("%d\n", var1.y);
  printf("The next two depend on the endian of the platform\n");
  printf("%d\n", var1.w); printf("%d\n", var1.z);

  varptr= &var1; varptr->x= 67;
  printf("%d\n", varptr->x); printf("%d\n", varptr->y);

  return(0);
}
```

This tests that all four members in the union are at the same location, so that
a change to one member is seen as the same change to all members. We also check
that pointer access into a union also works.

## Conclusion and What's Next

This was another nice and easy part of our compiler writing journey.
In the next part of our compiler writing journey, we will add enums.
