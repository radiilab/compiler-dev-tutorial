# Part 45: Global Variable Declarations, revisited

Two parts ago, I was trying to compile this line:

```c
enum { TEXTLEN = 512 };         // Length of identifiers in input
extern char Text[TEXTLEN + 1];
```

and realised that our declaration parsing code could only deal with
a single integer literal as the size of an array. But my compiler
code, as shown above, uses an expression with two integer literals.

In the last part, I added constant folding to the compiler so that
an expression of integer literals will be folded down to a single
integer literal.

Now we need to discard all of that  wonderful hand-written parsing of
the literal value and associated casting, and call our expression
parser to get an AST tree with the literal value in it.

## Keep or Discard `parse_literal()`?

In our current compiler in `decl.c`, we have a function called
`parse_literal()` which does the manual parsing of strings and integer
literals. Should we keep it as a function, or just throw it away and
call `binexpr()` manually elsewhere?

I've decided to keep the function, toss all the existing code and
change the purpose of this function a little bit. It will now
also parse any cast which precedes an expression with several literal
values.

The function header in `decl.c` is now:

```c
// Given a type, parse an expression of literals and ensure
// that the type of this expression matches the given type.
// Parse any type cast that precedes the expression.
// If an integer literal, return this value.
// If a string literal, return the label number of the string.
int parse_literal(int type);
```

So, it's a drop-in replacement for the old `parse_literal()` except
that any cast parsing code we had before can be discarded. Let's now
look at the new code in `parse_literal()`.

```c
int parse_literal(int type) {
  struct ASTnode *tree;

  // Parse the expression and optimise the resulting AST tree
  tree= optimise(binexpr(0));
```

Ahah. We call `binexpr()` to parse whatever expression is at this point
in the input file, and then `optimise()` to fold all the literal expressions.

Now, for this to be a tree we can use, the root node should be either
an A_INTLIT, an A_STRLIT or a A_CAST (if there was a preceding cast).

```c
  // If there's a cast, get the child and
  // mark it as having the type from the cast
  if (tree->op == A_CAST) {
    tree->left->type= tree->type;
    tree= tree->left;
  }
```

It was a cast, so we get rid of the A_CAST node but keep the type
that the child was cast to.


```c
  // The tree must now have an integer or string literal
  if (tree->op != A_INTLIT && tree->op != A_STRLIT)
    fatal("Cannot initialise globals with a general expression");
```

Oops, they gave us something we cannot use, so tell them and stop.

```c
  // If the type is char * and
  if (type == pointer_to(P_CHAR)) {
    // We have a string literal, return the label number
    if (tree->op == A_STRLIT)
      return(tree->a_intvalue);
    // We have a zero int literal, so that's a NULL
    if (tree->op == A_INTLIT && tree->a_intvalue==0)
      return(0);
  }
```

We need to be able to accept both of these as input:

```c
              char *c= "Hello";
              char *c= (char *)0;
```

and the two inner IF statements above match the two input lines shown.
If not a string literal, ...

```c
  // We only get here with an integer literal. The input type
  // is an integer type and is wide enough to hold the literal value
  if (inttype(type) && typesize(type, NULL) >= typesize(tree->type, NULL))
    return(tree->a_intvalue);

  fatal("Type mismatch: literal vs. variable");
  return(0);    // Keep -Wall happy
}
```

This took me a while to figure out. We have to parse these:

```c
  long  x= 3;    // allow this, where 3 is type char
  char  y= 4000; // prevent this, where 4000 is too wide
  char *z= 4000; // prevent this, as z is not integer type
```

so the IF statement checks the input type and ensures that it is
wide enough to accept the integer literal.

## The Other Parse Changes in `decl.c`

Now that we have a function that can parse a literal expression
possibly preceded by a cast, we can use it. This is where we toss
out our old cast parsing code and replace it. The changes are:

```c
// Parse a scalar declaration
static struct symtable *scalar_declaration(...) {
    ...
    // Globals must be assigned a literal value
    if (class == C_GLOBAL) {
      // Create one initial value for the variable and
      // parse this value
      sym->initlist= (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
      sym->initlist[0]= parse_literal(type);
    }
    ...
}

// Parse an array declaration
static struct symtable *array_declaration(...) {

  ...
  // See we have an array size
  if (Token.token != T_RBRACKET) {
    nelems= parse_literal(P_INT);
    if (nelems <= 0)
      fatald("Array size is illegal", nelems);
  }

  ...
  // Get the list of initial values
  while (1) {
    ...
    initlist[i++]= parse_literal(type);
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

By doing this, we lose about 20 to 30 lines of code to parse any
possible cast that used to come before the old `parse_literal()`.
Mind you, we had to add 100 lines of constant folding to get that
30 line reduction! Luckily, the constant folding is used in general
expressions as well as here, so it is still a win.

## One `expr.c` Change

There is one further change to our compiler code to support the
new `parse_literal()`. In our general function to parse expressions,
`binexpr()`, we now must inform it that an expression can be ended
by a '}' token, such as appears here:

```c
  int fred[]= { 1, 2, 6 };
```

The small change to `binexpr()` is:

```c
    // If we hit a terminating token, return just the left node
    tokentype = Token.token;
    if (tokentype == T_SEMI || tokentype == T_RPAREN ||
        tokentype == T_RBRACKET || tokentype == T_COMMA ||
        tokentype == T_COLON || tokentype == T_RBRACE) {    // T_RBRACE is new
      left->rvalue = 1;
      return (left);
    }
```

## Code to Test The Changes

Our existing tests will test the situation where there is a single literal
value to initialise a global variable. This code in `tests/input112.c`
tests both a literal expression to initialise a scalar variable, and
a literal expression as the size of an array:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
char* y = NULL;
int x= 10 + 6;
int fred [ 2 + 3 ];

int main() {
  fred[2]= x;
  printf("%d\n", fred[2]);
  return(0);
}
```

## Conclusion and What's Next

In the next part of our compiler writing journey, I will probably feed
more of the compiler source to itself and see what we still have to
implement.
