# Part 47: A Subset of `sizeof`

In a real C compiler, the `sizeof()` operator gives the size in bytes of:

 + a type definition, and
 + the type of an expression

I looked at the code in our compiler and I'm only using `sizeof()` for
the first of the two options above, so I'm only going to implement the
first one. This makes things a bit easier as we can assume that
the tokens inside the `sizeof()` are a type definition.

## New Token and Keyword

We need a "sizeof" keyword and a new token, T_SIZEOF. As per usual,
I'll let you look at the changes to `scan.c`.

Now, when adding new tokens, we also have to update the:

```c
// List of token strings, for debugging purposes
char *Tstring[] = {
  "EOF", "=", "+=", "-=", "*=", "/=",
  "||", "&&", "|", "^", "&",
  "==", "!=", ",", ">", "<=", ">=", "<<", ">>",
  "+", "-", "*", "/", "++", "--", "~", "!",
  "void", "char", "int", "long",
  "if", "else", "while", "for", "return",
  "struct", "union", "enum", "typedef",
  "extern", "break", "continue", "switch",
  "case", "default", "sizeof",
  "intlit", "strlit", ";", "identifier",
  "{", "}", "(", ")", "[", "]", ",", ".",
  "->", ":"
};
```

I initially forgot to do this, and when debugging I was seeing the "wrong"
token description for the tokens after "default". Oops!

## Changes to the Parser

The `sizeof()` operator is part of expression parsing, as it takes an
expression and returns a new value. We can do things like:

```c
  int x= 43 + sizeof(char);
```

Thus, we are going to modify `expr.c` to add `sizeof()`. It isn't a binary
operator, and it's not a prefix or postfix operator, so the best place to
add `sizeof()` is as part of parsing primary expressions.

In fact, once I found my silly bugs, the amount of new code to do `sizeof()`
was small. Here it is:

```c
// Parse a primary factor and return an
// AST node representing it.
static struct ASTnode *primary(void) {
  struct ASTnode *n;
  int id;
  int type=0;
  int size, class;
  struct symtable *ctype;

  switch (Token.token) {
  case T_SIZEOF:
    // Skip the T_SIZEOF and ensure we have a left parenthesis
    scan(&Token);
    if (Token.token != T_LPAREN)
      fatal("Left parenthesis expected after sizeof");
    scan(&Token);

    // Get the type inside the parentheses
    type= parse_stars(parse_type(&ctype, &class));
    // Get the type's size
    size= typesize(type, ctype);
    rparen();
    // Return a leaf node int literal with the size
    return (mkastleaf(A_INTLIT, P_INT, NULL, size));
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

We already have a `parse_type()` function to parse a type definition, and
we already have a `parse_stars()` function to parse any following asterisks.
Finally, we already have a `typesize()` function which returns the number of
bytes in a type. All we have to do is scan the tokens in, call these three
functions, build a leaf AST node with an integer literal in it, and return it.

Yes, I know there are a bunch of subtleties that go with `sizeof()`, but
I'm following the "KISS principle" and doing enough to make our compiler
self-compiling.

## Testing the New Code

The file `tests/input115.c` has a set of tests for the primitive types,
a pointer and for the structures in our compiler:

```c
struct foo { int x; char y; long z; }; 
typedef struct foo blah;

int main() {
  printf("%ld\n", sizeof(char));
  printf("%ld\n", sizeof(int));
  printf("%ld\n", sizeof(long));
  printf("%ld\n", sizeof(char *));
  printf("%ld\n", sizeof(blah));
  printf("%ld\n", sizeof(struct symtable));
  printf("%ld\n", sizeof(struct ASTnode));
  return(0);
}
```

At present, the output from our compiler is:

```
1
4
8
8
13
64
48
```

I'm wondering if we need to pad the `struct foo` struct to be 16 bytes instead
of 13. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

## Conclusion and What's Next

Well, `sizeof()` turned out to be simple, at least for the functionality that
we need for our compiler. In reality, `sizeof()` is quite complicated for
a full-blown production C compiler.

In the next part of our compiler writing journey, I will tackle `static`.
