# Part 4: An Actual Compiler

It's about time that I met my promise of actually writing a compiler.
So in this part of the journey we are going to replace the interpreter
in our program with code that generates x86-64 assembly code.

## Revising the Interpreter

Before we do, it will be worthwhile to revisit the interpreter code
in `interp.c`:

```c
int interpretAST(struct ASTnode *n) {
  int leftval, rightval;

  if (n->left) leftval = interpretAST(n->left);
  if (n->right) rightval = interpretAST(n->right);

  switch (n->op) {
    case A_ADD:      return (leftval + rightval);
    case A_SUBTRACT: return (leftval - rightval);
    case A_MULTIPLY: return (leftval * rightval);
    case A_DIVIDE:   return (leftval / rightval);
    case A_INTLIT:   return (n->intvalue);

    default:
      fprintf(stderr, "Unknown AST operator %d\n", n->op);
      exit(1);
  }
}
```

The `interpretAST()` function walks the given AST tree depth-first.
It evaluates any left sub-tree, then the right sub-tree. Finally, it
uses the `op` value at the base of the current tree to operate on
these children.

If the `op` value is one of the four maths operators, then this maths
operation is performed. If the `op` value indicates that the node
is simply an integer literal, the literal value is return.

The function returns the final value for this tree. And, as it is
recursive, it will calculate the final value for a whole tree
one sub-sub-tree at a time.

## Changing to Assembly Code Generation

We are going to write an assembly code generator which is generic.
This is, in turn, going to call out to a set of CPU-specific code
generation functions.

Here is the generic assembly code generator in `gen.c`:

```c
// Given an AST, generate
// assembly code recursively
static int genAST(struct ASTnode *n) {
  int leftreg, rightreg;

  // Get the left and right sub-tree values
  if (n->left) leftreg = genAST(n->left);
  if (n->right) rightreg = genAST(n->right);

  switch (n->op) {
    case A_ADD:      return (cgadd(leftreg,rightreg));
    case A_SUBTRACT: return (cgsub(leftreg,rightreg));
    case A_MULTIPLY: return (cgmul(leftreg,rightreg));
    case A_DIVIDE:   return (cgdiv(leftreg,rightreg));
    case A_INTLIT:   return (cgload(n->intvalue));

    default:
      fprintf(stderr, "Unknown AST operator %d\n", n->op);
      exit(1);
  }
}
```

Looks familar, huh?! We are doing the same depth-first tree traversal.
This time:

  + A_INTLIT: load a register with the literal value
  + Other operators: perform a maths function on the two registers
    that hold the left-child's and right-child's value

Instead of passing values, the code in `genAST()` passes around
register identifiers. For example `cgload()` loads a value into a register and
returns the identity of the register with the loaded value.

`genAST()` itself returns the identity of the register that holds the final
value of the tree at this point. That's why the code at the top is
getting register identities:

```c
  if (n->left) leftreg = genAST(n->left);
  if (n->right) rightreg = genAST(n->right);
```

## Calling `genAST()`

`genAST()` is only going to calculate the value of the expression given to
it. We need to print out this final calculation. We're also going to need
to wrap the assembly code we generate with some leading code (the
*preamble*) and some trailing code (the *postamble*). This is done with
the other function in `gen.c`:

```c
void generatecode(struct ASTnode *n) {
  int reg;

  cgpreamble();
  reg= genAST(n);
  cgprintint(reg);      // Print the register with the result as an int
  cgpostamble();
}
```

## The x86-64 Code Generator

That's the generic code generator out of the road. Now we need to look
at the generation of some real assembly code. For now, I'm targetting
the x86-64 CPU as this is still one of the most common Linux platforms.
So, open up `cg.c` and let's get browsing.

### Allocating Registers

Any CPU has a limited number of registers. We will have to allocate
a register to hold the integer literal values, plus any calculation
that we perform on them. However, once we've used a value, we can
often discard the value and hence free up the register holding it.
Then we can re-use that register for another value.

There are three functions that deal with register allocation:

 + `freeall_registers()`: Set all registers as available
 + `alloc_register()`: Allocate a free register
 + `free_register()`: Free an allocated register

I'm not going to go through the code as it's straight forward but with
some error checking. Right now, if I run out of registers then the
program will crash. Later on, I'll deal with the situation when we have
run out of free registers.

The code works on generic registers: r0, r1, r2 and r3. There is a table
of strings with the actual register names:

```c
static char *reglist[4]= { "%r8", "%r9", "%r10", "%r11" };
```

This makes these functions fairly independent of the CPU architecture.

### Loading a Register

This is done in `cgload()`: a register is allocated, then a `movq`
instruction loads a literal value into the allocated register.

```c
// Load an integer literal value into a register.
// Return the number of the register
int cgload(int value) {

  // Get a new register
  int r= alloc_register();

  // Print out the code to initialise it
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tmovq\t$%d, %s\n", value, reglist[r]);
  return(r);
}
```

### Adding Two Registers

`cgadd()` takes two register numbers and generates the code to add
them together. The result is saved in one of the two registers,
and the other one is then freed for future use:

```c
// Add two registers together and return
// the number of the register with the result
int cgadd(int r1, int r2) {
  fprintf(Outfile, "\taddq\t%s, %s\n", reglist[r1], reglist[r2]);
  free_register(r1);
  return(r2);
}
```

Note that addition is *commutative*, so I could have added `r2` to `r1`
instead of `r1` to `r2`. The identity of the register with the final
value is returned.

### Multiplying Two Registers

This is very similar to addition, and again the operation is
*commutative*, so any register can be returned:

```c
// Multiply two registers together and return
// the number of the register with the result
int cgmul(int r1, int r2) {
  fprintf(Outfile, "\timulq\t%s, %s\n", reglist[r1], reglist[r2]);
  free_register(r1);
  return(r2);
}
```

### Subtracting Two Registers

Subtraction is *not* commutative: we have to get the order correct.
The second register is subtracted from the first, so we return the
first and free the second:

```c
// Subtract the second register from the first and
// return the number of the register with the result
int cgsub(int r1, int r2) {
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tsubq\t%s, %s\n", reglist[r2], reglist[r1]);
  free_register(r2);
  return(r1);
}
```

### Dividing Two Registers

Division is also not commutative, so the previous notes apply. On
the x86-64, it's even more complicated. We need to load `%rax`
with the *dividend* from `r1`. This needs to be extended to eight
bytes with `cqo`. Then, `idivq` will divide `%rax` with the divisor
in `r2`, leaving the *quotient* in `%rax`, so we need to copy it
out to either `r1` or `r2`. Then we can free the other register.

```c
// Divide the first register by the second and
// return the number of the register with the result
int cgdiv(int r1, int r2) {
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tmovq\t%s,%%rax\n", reglist[r1]);
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tcqo\n");
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tidivq\t%s\n", reglist[r2]);
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tmovq\t%%rax,%s\n", reglist[r1]);
  free_register(r2);
  return(r1);
}
```

### Printing A Register

There isn't an x86-64 instruction to print a register out as a decimal
number. To solve this problem, the assembly preamble contains a function
called `printint()` that takes a register argument and calls `printf()`
to print this out in decimal.

I'm not going to give the code in `cgpreamble()`, but it also contains
the beginning code for `main()`, so that we can assemble our output file
to get a complete program. The code for `cgpostamble()`, also not given
here, simply calls `exit(0)` to end the program.

Here, however, is `cgprintint()`:

```c
void cgprintint(int r) {
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tmovq\t%s, %%rdi\n", reglist[r]);
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tcall\tprintint\n");
  free_register(r);
}
```

Linux x86-64 expects the first argument to a function to be in the `%rdi`
register, so we move our register into `%rdi` before we `call printint`.

## Doing Our First Compile

That's about it for the x86-64 code generator. There is some extra code
in `main()` to open out `out.s` as our output file. I've also left the
interpreter in the program so we can confirm that our assembly calculates
the same answer for the input expression as the interpreter.

Let's make the compiler and run it on `input01`:

```make
$ make
cc -o comp1 -g cg.c expr.c gen.c interp.c main.c scan.c tree.c

$ make test
./comp1 input01
15
cc -o out out.s
./out
15
```

Yes! The first 15 is the interpreter's output. The second 15 is the
assembly's output.

## Examining the Assembly Output

So, exactly what was the assembly output? Well, here is the input file:

```
2 + 3 * 5 - 8 / 3
```

and here is `out.s` for this input with comments:

```
        .text                           # Preamble code
.LC0:
        .string "%d\n"                  # "%d\n" for printf()
printint:
        pushq   %rbp
        movq    %rsp, %rbp              # Set the frame pointer
        subq    $16, %rsp
        movl    %edi, -4(%rbp)
        movl    -4(%rbp), %eax          # Get the printint() argument
        movl    %eax, %esi
        leaq    .LC0(%rip), %rdi        # Get the pointer to "%d\n"
        movl    $0, %eax
        call    printf@PLT              # Call printf()
        nop
        leave                           # and return
        ret

        .globl  main
        .type   main, @function
main:
        pushq   %rbp
        movq    %rsp, %rbp              # Set the frame pointer
                                        # End of preamble code

        movq    $2, %r8                 # %r8 = 2
        movq    $3, %r9                 # %r9 = 3
        movq    $5, %r10                # %r10 = 5
        imulq   %r9, %r10               # %r10 = 3 * 5 = 15
        addq    %r8, %r10               # %r10 = 2 + 15 = 17
                                        # %r8 and %r9 are now free again
        movq    $8, %r8                 # %r8 = 8
        movq    $3, %r9                 # %r9 = 3
        movq    %r8,%rax
        cqo                             # Load dividend %rax with 8
        idivq   %r9                     # Divide by 3
        movq    %rax,%r8                # Store quotient in %r8, i.e. 2
        subq    %r8, %r10               # %r10 = 17 - 2 = 15
        movq    %r10, %rdi              # Copy 15 into %rdi in preparation
        call    printint                # to call printint()

        movl    $0, %eax                # Postamble: call exit(0)
        popq    %rbp
        ret
```

Excellent! We now have a legitimate compiler: a program that takes
an input in one language and generates a translation of that input
in another language.

We still have to then assemble the output down to machine code and link
it with the support libraries, but this is something that we can
perform manually for now. Later on, we will write some code to do
this automatically.

## Conclusion and What's Next

Changing from the interpreter to a generic code generator was trivial, but then
we had to write some code to generate real assembly output. To do this,
we had to think about how to allocate registers: for now, we have a naive
solution. We also had to deal with some x86-64 oddities like the `idivq`
instruction.

Something I haven't touched on yet is: why bother with generating the AST for
an expression? Surely, we could have called `cgadd()` when we hit a '+'
token in our Pratt parser, ditto for the other operators. I'm going to
leave you to think about this, but I will come back to it in a step or
two.

In the next part of our compiler writing journey, we will add some
statements to our language, so that it starts to resemble a proper
computer language.
