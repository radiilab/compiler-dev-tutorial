# Part 50: Mopping Up, part 1

We have definitely reached the "mopping up" phase, as in this part
of our compiler writing journey I don't introduce any major feature.
Instead, I fix a couple of problems and add a couple of minor
functions.

## Consecutive Cases

At present, the compiler can't parse

```c
  switch(x) {
    case 1:
    case 2: printf("Hello\n");
  }
```

because the parser expects a compound statement after the ':' token.
In `switch_statement()` in `stmt.c`:

```c
        // Scan the ':' and get the compound expression
        match(T_COLON, ":");
        left= compound_statement(1); casecount++;
        ...
        // Build a sub-tree with the compound statement as the left child
        casetail->right= mkastunary(ASTop, 0, left, NULL, casevalue);
```

What we want is to allow an empty compound statement, so that any case
with a missing compound statement falls down into the next existing
compound statement.

The change in `switch_statement()` is:

```c
        // Scan the ':' and increment the casecount
        match(T_COLON, ":");
        casecount++;

        // If the next token is a T_CASE, the existing case will fall
        // into the next case. Otherwise, parse the case body.
        if (Token.token == T_CASE) 
          body= NULL;
        else
          body= compound_statement(1);
```

This is, however, only half the story. Now in the code generation section,
we have to catch the NULL compound statement and do something about it.
In `genSWITCH()` in `gen.c`:

```c
  // Walk the right-child linked list to
  // generate the code for each case
  for (i = 0, c = n->right; c != NULL; i++, c = c->right) {
    ...
    // Generate the case code. Pass in the end label for the breaks.
    // If case has no body, we will fall into the following body.
    if (c->left) genAST(c->left, NOLABEL, NOLABEL, Lend, 0);
    genfreeregs(NOREG);
  }
```

So, this was a nice and simple fix. `tests/input123.c` is the test program
to confirm this change works.

## Dumping the Symbol Table

While I was trying to work out why the global `Text` variable wasn't
visible to the compiler, I added code in `sym.c` to dump the symbol
table at the end of every source code file. There is an `-M` command
line argument to enable the functionality. I won't go through the code,
but here is an example of its output:

```
Symbols for misc.c
Global
--------
void exit(): global, 1 params
    int status: param, size 4
void _Exit(): global, 1 params
    int status: param, size 4
void *malloc(): global, 1 params
    int size: param, size 4
...
int Line: extern, size 4
int Putback: extern, size 4
struct symtable *Functionid: extern, size 8
char **Infile: extern, size 8
char **Outfile: extern, size 8
char *Text[]: extern, 513 elems, size 513
struct symtable *Globhead: extern, size 8
struct symtable *Globtail: extern, size 8
...
struct mkastleaf *mkastleaf(): global, 4 params
    int op: param, size 4
    int type: param, size 4
    struct symtable *sym: param, size 8
    int intvalue: param, size 4
...
Enums
--------
int (null): enumtype, size 0
int TEXTLEN: enumval, value 512
int (null): enumtype, size 0
int T_EOF: enumval, value 0
int T_ASSIGN: enumval, value 1
int T_ASPLUS: enumval, value 2
int T_ASMINUS: enumval, value 3
int T_ASSTAR: enumval, value 4
int T_ASSLASH: enumval, value 5
...
Typedefs
--------
long size_t: typedef, size 0
char *FILE: typedef, size 0
```

## Passing Arrays as Arguments

I made the following change, but in hindsight I realise that I probably 
need to rethink how I deal with arrays completely. Anyway ... when I
compile `decl.c` with the compiler, I get the error:

```
Unknown variable:Text on line 87 of decl.c
```

which prompted me to write the symbol dumping code. `Text` is in the global
symbol table, so why is the parser complaining that it's missing?

The answer is that `postfix()` in `expr.c`, after finding an identifier,
consults the following token. If it is a '[', then the identifier must
be an array. If there is no '[', then the identifier must be a variable:

```c
  // A variable. Check that the variable exists.
  if ((varptr = findsymbol(Text)) == NULL || varptr->stype != S_VARIABLE)
    fatals("Unknown variable", Text);
```

This is preventing the passing of an array reference as an argument to a
function. The "offending" line that prompts the error message is in `decl.c`:

```c
      type = type_of_typedef(Text, ctype);
```

We are passing the address of the base of `Text` as an argument. But with
no following '[', our compiler thinks that it's a scalar variable, and
complains that there is no scalar variable `Text`.

I made the change to allow S_ARRAY as well as S_VARIABLE here, but this is
just the tip of a bigger problem: arrays and pointers in our compiler are
not as interchangeable as they should be. I'll tackle this in the next part.

## Missing Operators

In our compiler, we've had these tokens and AST operators since part 21
of the journey:

 + <code>&#124;&#124;</code>, T_LOGOR, A_LOGOR
 + `&&`, T_LOGAND, A_LOGAND

Somehow, I'd never implemented them! So, it's time to do them.

For A_LOGAND, we have two expressions. If both evaluate to true, we need to
set a register to the rvalue of 1, otherwise 0. For A_LOGOR, if either
evaluate to true, we need to set a register to the rvalue of 1, otherwise 0.

The `binexpr()` code in `expr.c` already parses the tokens and builds the
A_LOGOR and A_LOGAND AST nodes. So we need to fix up the code generator.

In `genAST()` in `gen.c`, we now have:

```c
  case A_LOGOR:
    return (cglogor(leftreg, rightreg));
  case A_LOGAND:
    return (cglogand(leftreg, rightreg));
```

with two corresponding functions in `cg.c`. Before we look at the `cg.c`
functions, let's just see an example C expression and the assembly code
that will be produced.

```c
int x, y, z;
  ...
  z= x || y;
```

when compiled, results in:

```
        movslq  x(%rip), %r10           # Load x's rvalue
        movslq  y(%rip), %r11           # Load y's rvalue
        test    %r10, %r10              # Test x's boolean value
        jne     L13                     # True, jump to L13
        test    %r11, %r11              # Test y's boolean value
        jne     L13                     # True, jump to L13
        movq    $0, %r10                # Neither true, set %r10 to false
        jmp     L14                     # and jump to L14
L13:
        movq    $1, %r10                # Set %r10 to true
L14:
        movl    %r10d, z(%rip)          # Save boolean result to z
```

We test each expression, jump based on the boolean result and either
store 0 or 1 into our output register. The assembly for A_LOGAND is
similar, except that the conditional jumps are `je` (jump if equal to zero)
and the `movq $0` and `movq $1` are swapped around.

So, without further comment, are the new `cg.c` functions:

```c
// Logically OR two registers and return a
// register with the result, 1 or 0
int cglogor(int r1, int r2) {
  // Generate two labels
  int Ltrue = genlabel();
  int Lend = genlabel();

  // Test r1 and jump to true label if true
  fprintf(Outfile, "\ttest\t%s, %s\n", reglist[r1], reglist[r1]);
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tjne\tL%d\n", Ltrue);

  // Test r2 and jump to true label if true
  fprintf(Outfile, "\ttest\t%s, %s\n", reglist[r2], reglist[r2]);
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tjne\tL%d\n", Ltrue);

  // Didn't jump, so result is false
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tmovq\t$0, %s\n", reglist[r1]);
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tjmp\tL%d\n", Lend);

  // Someone jumped to the true label, so result is true
  cglabel(Ltrue);
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tmovq\t$1, %s\n", reglist[r1]);
  cglabel(Lend);
  free_register(r2);
  return(r1);
}
```

```c
// Logically AND two registers and return a
// register with the result, 1 or 0
int cglogand(int r1, int r2) {
  // Generate two labels
  int Lfalse = genlabel();
  int Lend = genlabel();

  // Test r1 and jump to false label if not true
  fprintf(Outfile, "\ttest\t%s, %s\n", reglist[r1], reglist[r1]);
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tje\tL%d\n", Lfalse);

  // Test r2 and jump to false label if not true
  fprintf(Outfile, "\ttest\t%s, %s\n", reglist[r2], reglist[r2]);
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tje\tL%d\n", Lfalse);

  // Didn't jump, so result is true
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tmovq\t$1, %s\n", reglist[r1]);
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tjmp\tL%d\n", Lend);

  // Someone jumped to the false label, so result is false
  cglabel(Lfalse);
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tmovq\t$0, %s\n", reglist[r1]);
  cglabel(Lend);
  free_register(r2);
  return(r1);
}
```

The program `tests/input122.c` is the test to confirm that this new
functionality works.

## Conclusion and What's Next

So that's a few small things fixed up in this part of our journey.
What I will do now is step back, rethink the array/pointer design and
try to fix this up in the next part of our compiler writing journey.
