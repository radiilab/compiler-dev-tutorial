# Part 14: Generating ARM Assembly Code

In this part of our compiler writing journey, I've ported the compiler
over to the ARM CPU on the
[Raspberry Pi 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi).

I should preface this section by saying that, while I know MIPS assembly
language quite well, I only knew a bit of x86-32 assembly language when I
started this journey, and nothing about x86-64 nor ARM assembly language.

What I've been doing along the way is compiling example C programs down
to an assembler with various C compilers to see what sort of assembly
language they produce. That's what I've done here  to write the ARM
output for this compiler.

## The Major Differences

Firstly, ARM is a RISC CPU and x86-64 is a CISC CPU. There are fewer
addressing modes on the ARM when compared to the x86-64. There are also
other interesting constraints that occur when generating ARM assembly code.
So I will start with the major differences, and leave the main similarities
to later.

### ARM Registers

ARM has heaps more registers than x86-64. That said, I'm sticking with four
registers to allocate: `r4`,`r5`, `r6` and `r7`. We will see that `r0` and
`r3` get used for other things below.

### Addressing Global Variables

On x86-64, we only have to declare a global variable with a line like:

```
        .comm   i,4,4        # int variable
        .comm   j,1,1        # char variable
``` 

and, later, we can load and store to these variables easily:

```
        movb    %r8b, j(%rip)    # Store to j
        movl    %r8d, i(%rip)    # Store to i
        movzbl  i(%rip), %r8     # Load from i
        movzbq  j(%rip), %r8     # Load from j
```

With ARM, we have to manually allocate space for all global variables
in our program postamble:

```
        .comm   i,4,4
        .comm   j,1,1
...
.L2:
        .word i
        .word j
```

To access these, we need to load a register with the address of each
variable, and load a second register from that address:

```
        ldr     r3, .L2+0
        ldr     r4, [r3]        # Load i
        ldr     r3, .L2+4
        ldr     r4, [r3]        # Load j
```

Stores to variables are similar:

```
        mov     r4, #20
        ldr     r3, .L2+4
        strb    r4, [r3]        # i= 20
        mov     r4, #10
        ldr     r3, .L2+0
        str     r4, [r3]        # j= 10
```

There is now this code in `cgpostamble()` to generate the table of .words:

```c
  // Print out the global variables
  fprintf(Outfile, ".L2:\n");
  for (int i = 0; i < Globs; i++) {
    if (Gsym[i].stype == S_VARIABLE)
      fprintf(Outfile, "\t.word %s\n", Gsym[i].name);
  }
```

This also means that we need to determine the offset from `.L2` for each
global variable. Following the KISS principle, I manually calculate the
offset each time I want to load `r3` with the address of a variable.
Yes, I should calculate each offset once and store it somewhere; later!

```c
// Determine the offset of a variable from the .L2
// label. Yes, this is inefficient code.
static void set_var_offset(int id) {
  int offset = 0;
  // Walk the symbol table up to id.
  // Find S_VARIABLEs and add on 4 until
  // we get to our variable

  for (int i = 0; i < id; i++) {
    if (Gsym[i].stype == S_VARIABLE)
      offset += 4;
  }
  // Load r3 with this offset
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tldr\tr3, .L2+%d\n", offset);
}
```

### Loading Int Literals

The size of an integer literal in a load instruction is limited to 11 bits
and I think this is a signed value. Thus, we can't put large integer literals
into a single instruction. That answer is to store the literal values in
memory, like variables. So I keep a list of previously-used literal
values. In the postamble, I output them following the `.L3` label. And, like
variables, I walk this list to determine the offset of any literal from
the `.L3` label:

```c
// We have to store large integer literal values in memory.
// Keep a list of them which will be output in the postamble
#define MAXINTS 1024
int Intlist[MAXINTS];
static int Intslot = 0;

// Determine the offset of a large integer
// literal from the .L3 label. If the integer
// isn't in the list, add it.
static void set_int_offset(int val) {
  int offset = -1;

  // See if it is already there
  for (int i = 0; i < Intslot; i++) {
    if (Intlist[i] == val) {
      offset = 4 * i;
      break;
    }
  }

  // Not in the list, so add it
  if (offset == -1) {
    offset = 4 * Intslot;
    if (Intslot == MAXINTS)
      fatal("Out of int slots in set_int_offset()");
    Intlist[Intslot++] = val;
  }
  // Load r3 with this offset
  fprintf(Outfile, "\tldr\tr3, .L3+%d\n", offset);
}
```

### The Function Preamble

I'm going to give you the function preamble, but I am not completely
sure what each instruction does. Here it is for `int main(int x)`:

```
  .text
  .globl        main
  .type         main, %function
  main:         push  {fp, lr}          # Save the frame and stack pointers
                add   fp, sp, #4        # Add sp+4 to the stack pointer
                sub   sp, sp, #8        # Lower the stack pointer by 8
                str   r0, [fp, #-8]     # Save the argument as a local var?
```

and here's the function postamble to return a single value:

```
                sub   sp, fp, #4        # ???
                pop   {fp, pc}          # Pop the frame and stack pointers
```

### Comparisons Returning 0 or 1

With the x86-64 there's an instruction to set a register to 0 or 1
based on the comparison being true, e.g. `sete`, but then we have to
zero-fill the rest of the register with `movzbq`. With the ARM, we run
two separate instructions which set a register to a value if the condition
we want is true or false, e.g.

```
                moveq r4, #1            # Set r4 to 1 if values were equal
                movne r4, #0            # Set r4 to 0 if values were not equal
```

## A Comparison of Similar x86-64 and ARM Assembly Output

I think that's all the major differences out of the road. So below
is a comparison of the `cgXXX()` operation, any specific type for that
operation, and an example x86-64 and ARM instruction sequence to
perform it.

## Testing the ARM Code Generator

If you copy the compiler from this part of the journey to
a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4, you should be able to do:

```
$ make armtest
cc -o comp1arm -g -Wall cg_arm.c decl.c expr.c gen.c main.c misc.c
      scan.c stmt.c sym.c tree.c types.c
cp comp1arm comp1
(cd tests; chmod +x runtests; ./runtests)
input01: OK
input02: OK
input03: OK
input04: OK
input05: OK
input06: OK
input07: OK
input08: OK
input09: OK
input10: OK
input11: OK
input12: OK
input13: OK
input14: OK

$ make armtest14
./comp1 tests/input14
cc -o out out.s lib/printint.c
./out
10
20
30
```

## Conclusion and What's Next

It did take me a bit of head scratching to get the ARM version of
the code generator `cg_arm.c` to correctly compile all of the test
inputs. It was mostly straight-forward, I just wasn't familiar with
the architecture and instruction set.

It should be relatively easy to port the compiler to a platform with
3 or 4 registers, 2 or so data sizes and a stack (and stack frames).
As we go forward, I'll try to keep both `cg.c` and `cg_arm.c`
functionally in sync.

In the next part of our compiler writing journey, we will add the `char`
pointer to the language, as well as the '*' and '&' unary operators.
